# Urbanism Notes

Personal urbanism notes, organized as an Obsidian vault.

## Usage

Open this folder in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to browse and edit notes with full linking and graph view capabilities.

## Maintenance

Use `make` commands for repository maintenance:

- `make check-lint` - Check markdown formatting
- `make fix-lint` - Auto-fix markdown issues
- `make install` - Install dependencies and pre-commit hooks
- `make help` - Show all available commands

Pre-commit hooks automatically run `markdownlint` before each commit.
